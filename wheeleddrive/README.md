# C++ ZetaBot API for the Raspberry PI 5

## Prerequisites

Add to `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

```
dtoverlay=pwm-2chan
```

and reboot.

Check with:

```
pinctrl -p
```

that you see:

```
12: a3    pd | lo // GPIO18 = PWM0_CHAN2
35: a3    pd | lo // GPIO19 = PWM0_CHAN3
```

which corresponds to the sysfs files:

```
/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm2: GPIO18 
/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm3: GPIO19
```

### libgpiod

The GPIO pins are accessed via the C++ API of the `libgpiod`:

```
apt-get install libgpiod-dev
```

### ncurses

This is needed for testIO for a very simple ASCII GUI!

```
apt-get install libncurses-dev
```

## Building

The built system is `cmake`. Just type:
```
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

### Starting

Create an instance of ZetaBot and call start() to start the PWM on the motors.

### Motor speed

Setting the speeds of the left/right wheels:
```
setLeftWheelSpeed(float speed);
setRightWheelSpeed(float speed);
```
where speed is between -1 and +1.

### Stopping

call stop() to stop the motors and to disable PWM.

## Demo programs

 - `testIO` is a simple text GUI program to control the motors.
 - `testMotor` ramps up the motor speed and back again.

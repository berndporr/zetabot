What is the Zeta-Bot?

The Zeta-Bot is an open-source robot platform that uses the:

 - Raspberry PI 5,
 - [Parallax's Continuous Rotation Servo Motors](https://www.parallax.com/product/parallax-continuous-rotation-servo/),
 - [C1 LIDAR](https://www.slamtec.com/en/c1),
 - two [Raspberry PI V2 cameras](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) for stereo vision,
 - [a standard mobile phone 1700mAh power bank](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/power-banks/2498449).

It's based on years and years of experience making single PCB
Raspberry PI based robots. Every part has been chosen because of
extensive lab use proving its reliability over the years and because
of its solid hard- and software support.

## Hardware

The KiCad design files and BOM are in [hardware](hardware).

## Software

It's all in C++! Both cameras and LIDAR have an event driven framework with callbacks so no loops and multi-threaded by design.

 - The motor control libraries are in [wheeleddrive](wheeleddrive).
 - The cameras driver is in https://github.com/berndporr/libcamera2opencv with a demo to display one camera and in [stereo](stereo) is a QT6 based stereo viewer and disparity detector.
 - The LIDAR driver is in https://github.com/berndporr/c1lidar
